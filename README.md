# basicInterestCalculator
Basic compound interest calculator using vanilla JavaScript.  Used bootstrap for styling, and included a loading animation and error message for a bit of user experience.  
I also used the loading.gif file - attached.  Within the root folder that contained the index.html and app.js files, I had an /img file to hold the loading.gif file.  You will need to make sure the file path that you use is correct if you want the image to run as intended.
